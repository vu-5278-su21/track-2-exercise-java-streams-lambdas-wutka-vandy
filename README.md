# Overview

This programming exercise will help you practice Java programming with Streams
and Lambdas.

Start by looking in the edu.vanderbilt.cs.streams.BikeRide class. You will need 
to complete the instructions in this class and get the BikeRideTest to compile 
and pass. Next, work on StreamUtils and get the associated test to pass. 
Finally, complete the BikeStats class. 

The exercise uses real JSON data from Strava.

## Running the Tests

You can run the JUnit tests in your IDE or from the 
command line using "gradle test". Every time that you commit and push
to GitHub, GitHub Actions will compile and test your code. You can 
view the results on the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
